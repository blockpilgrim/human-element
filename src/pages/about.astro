  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>The Daily Sublime is a secular devotional — a daily blog that offers a curated passage from literature, poetry, or philosophy, paired with a thoughtful reflection.</p>

  <p>It's for anyone who feels spiritual longing but doesn't find a home in traditional religion. The "nones," the skeptics, the Spinoza-curious, the lapsed believers, the atheists who still cry at sunsets.</p>

  <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>

  <p>Each morning, a new entry appears: a passage — a poem, a paragraph, a fragment — selected from the vast wealth of human writing that speaks to wonder, mortality, meaning, and presence. Below it, a brief reflection: not analysis, not instruction, just a few hundred words of thinking alongside the text.</p>

  <p>Passages are drawn from across cultures and centuries: Stoic philosophers and Romantic poets, Zen Buddhism and American transcendentalism, contemporary nature writers and ancient mystics read as literature. The thread connecting them is attention — the conviction that the sacred can be found in looking carefully, not in believing correctly.</p>

  <h2>On the Commentary</h2>

  <p>The reflections are generated with the assistance of AI (Claude by Anthropic), guided by prompts that emphasize warmth, nuance, and intellectual honesty. This is stated openly because transparency matters. The goal is not to simulate a human voice but to offer a thoughtful companion to the passage — one that connects it to lived experience and invites further contemplation.</p>

  <h2>Who This Is For</h2>

  <p>You might have Ryan Holiday's <em>The Daily Stoic</em> on your shelf. You might have left a childhood religion. You probably have a complicated relationship with the word "God." You want something to read with your morning coffee that isn't the news.</p>

  <p>If any of that resonates, you're welcome here.</p>
