passage: |
  If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern.

Blake wrote these lines in the throes of revolution—French, American, industrial—when the old orders were cracking open. Yet his revolution was interior: a war against the dulling of the senses, against the way habit turns the miraculous into furniture.

What strikes me most is that word "cleansed." Not sharpened, not improved, not upgraded. Cleansed—as if our ordinary perception is already sufficient, merely obscured. We don't need new eyes; we need to wash the film from the ones we have. The infinite isn't hiding somewhere exotic. It's here, in the grain of the wooden table, in the steam rising from a cup, in the particular way light falls through a window this morning and will never fall quite the same way again.

The "narrow chinks" feel uncomfortably familiar. How much of any given day do we actually see? We navigate by category and assumption, by mental shorthand that gets us efficiently from task to task while the world streams past unwitnessed. This isn't a failing so much as a necessity—we'd be overwhelmed otherwise. But Blake is pointing to something we lose in the trade: the strangeness of existence itself, the raw fact that anything exists at all rather than nothing.

There's no technique offered here, no five-step program for cleansing perception. Perhaps the awareness alone is the beginning—noticing the cavern, feeling the narrowness of the chinks. Sometimes a single moment of genuine attention, a pause in the rushing, lets a sliver of the infinite leak through. The coffee tastes like something. The face across the table becomes, briefly, unfathomable. The world, for one breath, is new.
