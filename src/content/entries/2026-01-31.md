passage: |
  You do not have to be good.
  You do not have to walk on your knees
  for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
  You only have to let the soft animal of your body
  love what it loves.

There's a reason this poem has been pinned to so many refrigerators, read at so many funerals, whispered to so many people in crisis. It offers permission. And permission, it turns out, is what many of us most desperately need.

"You do not have to be good." What a strange way to begin. We expect poems to tell us to be better — kinder, more disciplined, more worthy. But Oliver starts by releasing us from the whole project. Not because goodness doesn't matter, but because the striving, the self-flagellation, the hundred-mile crawl through the desert of our own judgment — this is not the path.

The path, she suggests, is through the body. Through letting it "love what it loves." This is not hedonism. It's something closer to trust. The soft animal of your body knows things. It knows what it's drawn to, what makes it come alive, what feels like home. And so much of life is spent overriding those signals in favor of what we think we should want.

This morning, consider: what does the soft animal of your body love? Not what should you love. Not what would be impressive to love. Just — what do you actually love? And can you let yourself move toward it, even a little?
