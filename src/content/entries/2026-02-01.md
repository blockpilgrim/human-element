title: "Veritably Myself"

passage: |
  Once upon a time, I, Chuang Chou, dreamt that I was a butterfly, fluttering hither and thither, to all intents and purposes a butterfly. I was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly, unaware that I was Chou. Soon I awaked, and there I was, veritably myself again. Now I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly, dreaming I am a man.

There's a sly humor in Chuang Tzu's declaration that he returned to being "veritably" himself, followed immediately by the elegant collapse of that certainty. We all know this sensation—the groggy conviction upon waking that we have settled back into our proper skin, only to carry with us the lingering emotional residue of whatever world we just left. The dream felt real; waking feels real; both cannot be true, yet both felt undeniable in their moment. The word "veritably" stands guard like a sentry who has already fallen asleep on duty, insisting on a security that the story immediately dissolves.

What strikes me most is not the philosophical puzzle but the butterfly's complete absorption in its own existence. Chuang Tzu was "conscious only of my happiness," unaware of any Chou who might be dreaming. There is a profound relief in this total immersion, a suspension of the self-consciousness that plagues our waking hours. The butterfly does not question its reality; it simply flutters, drinks, and is. We spend so much effort constructing and defending our sense of "veritably myself"—our stories, our boundaries, our certainties about who we are and what we are not—when perhaps the happier state is forgetting the dreamer entirely.

Yet the story ends not with anxiety but with a shrug, a philosophical laugh that echoes across millennia. To not know whether one is man or butterfly is not a crisis but a liberation from the rigid categories we impose on fluid experience. Perhaps the point is not to solve the riddle but to recognize that we are always, in some sense, dreaming and being dreamed, changing and being changed. The boundary between selves is more permeable than we comfortably admit, and reality less fragile than our desperate need to name it.
