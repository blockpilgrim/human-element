passage: |
  Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back,
  Guilty of dust and sin.
  But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack
  From my first entrance in,
  Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning,
  If I lacked anything.

  A guest, I answered, worthy to be here:
  Love said, You shall be he.
  I the unkind, ungrateful? Ah my dear,
  I cannot look on thee.
  Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,
  Who made the eyes but I?

  Truth Lord, but I have marred them: let my shame
  Go where it doth deserve.
  And know you not, says Love, who bore the blame?
  My dear, then I will serve.
  You must sit down, says Love, and taste my meat:
  So I did sit and eat.

There is a peculiar shame that comes with being human, a dustiness that clings to the sleeves of our best intentions. We arrive at the door of our own lives carrying the empty plates of our failures, convinced we must earn the right to sit at the table. We rehearse apologies before we receive invitations, certain that we should be turned away for the stains we carry.

George Herbert’s portrait of Love offers something else entirely—not a ladder to climb, nor a test to pass, but a meal already prepared. The voice in the poem does not argue with our self-accusation; it simply offers a different fact. *Who made the eyes but I?* The question disarms us. We are not being asked to prove our value but to recognize our origin. The shame we carried in the door is not denied or scolded, only gently relieved of its burden and sent where it deserves to go.

To taste the meat is to agree that we are allowed here, in this moment, without having fixed ourselves first. It is the hardest thing—to sit down while still feeling unkind, ungrateful, unfinished. But love, Herbert suggests, is not a reward for cleanliness; it is the very food that makes us capable of being clean. The only requirement is appetite. We eat, and in eating, we become the guest we never believed we could be.
