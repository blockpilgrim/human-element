passage: |
  I cannot forbear to mention among these precepts a new device for study which, although it may seem but trivial and almost ludicrous, is nevertheless extremely useful in arousing the mind to various inventions. And this is, when you look at a wall spotted with stains, or with a mixture of stones, if you have to devise some scene, you may discover a resemblance to various landscapes, beautified with mountains, rivers, rocks, trees, plains, wide valleys and hills in varied arrangement; or again you may see battles and figures in action, or strange faces and costumes, and an endless variety of objects, which you could reduce to complete and well-drawn forms. And these appear on such walls confusedly, like the sound of bells in whose jangle you may find any name or word you choose to imagine.

Leonardo nearly apologizes for this advice. He calls it "trivial and almost ludicrous," as though he already hears the objection that serious artists should conjure visions from skill and imagination alone, not from stains on a wall. Five centuries later, that same defensiveness surfaces whenever someone describes a creative process that depends on found patterns, on chance encounters with material outside the self.

What's remarkable is how active the looking he describes really is. The wall offers nothing on its own: accidents of stone and moisture, nothing more. The landscapes and battles and strange faces emerge only through a mind already stocked with such things, a mind long practiced in composition. Leonardo is describing a redeployment of artistic labor, where the effort shifts from generating raw material to perceiving form within what already exists. The wall does not create. The mind before the wall creates.

That shift resonates now in ways Leonardo could not have anticipated. Many of us find ourselves scanning outputs we didn't fully generate, looking for the shape of something real amid overwhelming abundance. And the jangling bells at the close of the passage make the question more unsettling, not less. "You may find any name or word you choose to imagine," he writes. If anything can be found, is the finding still an act of creative skill? Or does its value depend entirely on the particular quality of perception we've spent years cultivating? Leonardo doesn't resolve this. He simply notes that the device works, that it sounds ridiculous, and that he cannot forbear to mention it anyway. The tension between usefulness and absurdity is, perhaps, exactly where we still live.
