passage: |
  We cannot know his legendary head
  with eyes like ripening fruit. And yet his torso
  is still suffused with brilliance from inside,
  like a lamp, in which his gaze, now turned to low,

  gleams in all its power. Otherwise
  the curved breast could not dazzle you so, nor could
  a smile run through the placid hips and thighs
  to that dark center where procreation flared.

  Otherwise this stone would seem defaced
  beneath the translucent cascade of the shoulders
  and would not glisten like a wild beast's fur:

  would not, from all the borders of itself,
  burst like a star: for here there is no place
  that does not see you. You must change your life.

There is a particular shock that comes from being truly seen by something that has no eyes. We wander through galleries and mornings with our own vision leading the way, assuming ourselves to be the sole witnesses of our lives. Then we round a corner and meet a ruin that glows. Rilke’s torso is missing its head, its arms, its legs—dismembered by time, defaced by history—and yet it possesses a completeness that intact statues rarely achieve. The absence becomes a kind of presence, more piercing than any intact gaze.

What arrests us is not the damage but the radiance. The stone has become a lamp, a star, a predator’s pelt, all because something inside it refused to extinguish. It is as if the sculpture understood that being broken is not the same as being dimmed. When Rilke tells us that "there is no place / that does not see you," he is describing an intimacy without comfort. This is not the gentle encouragement of a friend; it is the verdict of beauty that knows our potential. We stand before the fragment and realize we are fragments too—yet here is a fragment that has learned to shine.

The command that ends the poem arrives like a bell after a long silence. It is not a punishment for our failures but the necessary consequence of being recognized. To be seen so utterly is to be reminded that we are still becoming. The torso has surrendered everything but its essence, and in that stripping away, it has grown luminous. Perhaps the change demanded of us is similar: not an accumulation of more, but a fierce, gentle stripping down until we, too, are unable to hide.
