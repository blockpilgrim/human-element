passage: |
  You do not have to be good.
  You do not have to walk on your knees
  for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
  You only have to let the soft animal of your body
  love what it loves.

"Wild Geese" opens with what might be the most generous five lines in modern poetry. Not a command, not a lesson — a release. "You do not have to be good." We expect poems to tell us to be better. Oliver starts by letting us off the hook entirely.

"You only have to let the soft animal of your body / love what it loves." This is not hedonism. It's something closer to trust. The soft animal of your body knows things. It knows what it's drawn to, what makes it come alive, what feels like home. And so much of life is spent overriding those signals in favor of what we think we should want.

The poem continues from here into a wider landscape — geese flying overhead, the world offering itself to your imagination — but these opening lines are where most people get stopped in their tracks. They carry the weight of permission, and permission, it turns out, is what many of us most desperately need.

This morning, consider: what does the soft animal of your body love? Not what should you love. Not what would be impressive to love. Just — what do you actually love?
