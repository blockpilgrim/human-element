passage: |
  I dwell in Possibility –
  A fairer House than Prose –
  More numerous of Windows –
  Superior – for Doors –

  Of Chambers as the Cedars –
  Impregnable of eye –
  And for an everlasting Roof
  The Gambrels of the Sky –

  Of Visitors – the fairest –
  For Occupation – This –
  The spreading wide my narrow Hands
  To gather Paradise –

There is a particular pressure in modern life to live in prose. We are asked to be practical, realistic, to dwell in the declarative sentences of what is already known. Bills must be paid, schedules kept, expectations met. But Emily Dickinson suggests we might choose a different address entirely—a house built not of brick and constraint, but of windows and sky.

Notice how she constructs this dwelling. It has more windows than prose, suggesting a structure designed for light rather than security. The doors are superior, implying that leaving is as important as entering, that this house is meant for passage rather than permanence. The chambers smell of cedar, impregnable to the intrusive eye, offering privacy for the strange work of becoming. And the roof? Not slate or tile, but the gambrels of the sky itself—an architecture that opens endlessly upward rather than closing protectively overhead.

What strikes me most is the final image: spreading narrow hands to gather Paradise. We expect grand gestures for such a task, arms thrown wide to capture the infinite. But Dickinson gives us narrow hands, human hands, limited in their reach. The gathering is not about grasping the whole sky, but about the posture of openness, the willingness to receive what falls into our small circumference. 

We wake each morning to the same choice. We can inhabit the house that has already been built for us—the prose of obligation and precedent—or we can dwell in possibility, where the floors are uneven and the rooms rearrange themselves, but where the light is different, and the doors, thank God, swing both ways.
