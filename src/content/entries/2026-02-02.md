passage: |
  No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you must set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead. I mean this as a principle of aesthetic, not merely historical, criticism. The necessity that he shall conform, that he shall cohere, is not onesided; what happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it. The existing monuments form an ideal order among themselves, which is modified by the introduction of the new (the really new) work of art among them. The existing order is complete before the new work arrives; for order to persist after the supervention of novelty, the whole existing order must be, if ever so slightly, altered; and so the relations, proportions, values of each work of art toward the whole are readjusted; and this is conformity between the old and the new.

We tend to imagine creation as origination, the artist as source. But Eliot, writing over a century ago, proposed something different: that the significance of any work lies in its relations. Not the artist alone, but the artist among the dead. Every work finds its meaning through contrast and comparison with what came before.

For those worried about originality in an age of automated generation, this might be either consolation or disquiet. The old comfort that creative work springs from some purely personal source was always partly myth. We've always been trained on what we've read, shaped by what we've absorbed. The borders of the self were never as clear as we pretended. Perhaps the question isn't whether machines can also be shaped by their inputs, but what kind of shaping makes something alive.

Yet Eliot also describes something crucial: the "(really new)" work that enters the existing order and, through entering, alters it. Not just another addition to the pile but a rearrangement, a shift in how we see everything that came before. The new work doesn't reject tradition; it joins tradition with enough force to change what tradition means.

What determines whether we truly join the conversation or merely echo it? Perhaps what matters is the quality of our attention to what we've inherited, and the particular pressure we bring to it. Each of us encounters the tradition differently, carries different questions, notices different things. The dead writers, as Eliot says elsewhere, "are that which we know." What we do with that knowing is the work.
