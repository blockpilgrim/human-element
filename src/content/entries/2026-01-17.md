passage: |
  I had not a dispute but a disquisition with Dilke, upon various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously – I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason – Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration.

There is a particular agitation that comes from not knowing, a restlessness that makes the fingers twitch toward any tool promising resolution. Keats, writing to his brothers in 1817, identifies this as the "irritable reaching after fact and reason"—the compulsion to resolve mystery before it has finished speaking to us. He proposes instead a "Negative Capability," a willingness to inhabit uncertainty without rushing to collapse it into certainty.

We live in an age of irritable reaching. The gap between question and answer has never been narrower, the silence between thought and articulation so easily filled. Yet Keats suggests that this very gap is where creative life happens—in the "half-knowledge," the suspended moment where something "dove-tailed" in the mind without yet resolving into form. The danger is not that we find answers, but that we lose the capacity to remain in the question long enough for the real question to reveal itself.

What suffers when we outsource our uncertainty? Perhaps it is the quality of attention itself, the steady gaze that waits for "fine isolated verisimilitude" to emerge from the Penetralium of mystery. Shakespeare possessed this patience; Coleridge, Keats suggests, did not. The machine answers with Coleridge's impatience, generating the verisimilitude without the mystery. We are left to wonder whether we can still tolerate the discomfort of not knowing long enough to become the kind of poets—makers—who can hold the doubt without filling it.
