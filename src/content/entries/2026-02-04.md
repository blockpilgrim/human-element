There is a bridge. It stands there, perfectly good, built for exactly this purpose—to carry us across without wetting our feet, without slowing our pace, without the mess of the world touching us. And yet the horse walks into the water. Not because the bridge has failed, not because the horse is stubborn or romantic, but because sometimes the body knows what the map forgets. We spend so much of our lives building bridges—routines, efficiencies, careful plans that keep us above the current, dry and dignified. We forget that the river is not merely an obstacle to be overcome but a place to be inhabited, if only for a moment.

I love that the poem does not tell us whether the rider protests or relents. The horse decides. There is a surrender in that, a recognition that we are not always the ones who must choose the wisest path. We ride atop instincts older than our strategies, and sometimes wisdom means letting the muscles and the hooves feel the cool shock of the stream, the stones shifting beneath, the water rising to the belly. The bridge will still be there when we need it. But today, the horse chooses the way through rather than over.

There is no drama in this decision, no rebellion against civilization. The bridge is not mocked; it simply goes unused this time. It is a quiet declaration that efficiency is not the only virtue, that the direct encounter with what is real—cold, wet, immediate—has its own dignity. We can spend our lives crossing above the current, or we can let the water carry our weight for a while, feeling the pull of the river as it moves, as we move, through the summer afternoon.
