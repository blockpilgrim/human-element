passage: |
  No worst, there is none. Pitched past pitch of grief,
  More pangs will, schooled at forepangs, wilder wring.
  Comforter, where, where is your comforting?
  Mary, mother of us, where is your relief?
  My cries heave, herds-long; huddle in a main, a chief
  Woe, world-sorrow; on an age-old anvil wince and sing—
  Then lull, then leave off. Fury had shrieked 'No ling-
  ering! Let me be fell: force I must be brief'.

  O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall
  Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed. Hold them cheap
  May who ne'er hung there. Nor does long our small
  Durance deal with that steep or deep. Here! creep,
  Wretch, under a comfort serves in a whirlwind: all
  Life death does end and each day dies with sleep.

There are thresholds of sorrow that feel like the end of language itself, where pain seems to compound beyond its own limits. Hopkins writes from such a place—not to offer a map out, but to testify that these interior landscapes exist, sheer and uncharted. When he speaks of being "pitched past pitch of grief," he captures that vertigo of discovering our capacity for hurting can expand just when we believe we've reached its boundary. The mind reveals itself as terrain more rugged than we imagined, with "cliffs of fall / Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed."

It is a lonely geography. The cry for the Comforter goes unanswered; even the maternal solace of Mary offers no relief here. In this solitude, grief becomes a kind of weather we inhabit rather than a storm we watch from safety. Hopkins's sprung, straining rhythms—those enjambments that break across lines like waves—mimic the staggering exhaustion of simply remaining upright in such conditions. We do not choose these descents; they choose us, and we find ourselves "wretch[ed]," huddled beneath whatever shelter we can improvise.

Yet the poem does not end where the anguish peaks. There is a strange, bruised mercy in the final lines—not a triumph, but a recognition of our small endurance. We are given, each evening, a miniature dissolution: "each day dies with sleep." It is not healing, exactly, but it is a reprieve, a rhythm older than our pain. In the willingness to let the day end, to surrender consciousness and trust the dark, we practice the patience that survival requires. The mountains remain, but so does the valley of rest; we climb, descend, and somehow continue.
