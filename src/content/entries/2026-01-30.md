passage: |
  I am living just as the century ends.

  A great rain is coming. The fields are already wet.
  I watch the valley from a window. The grasses
  change their color as the year advances.

  I am not young. And yet I feel young.
  What is time? The leaves are blowing.
  Life unrolls like an endless bolt of cloth.

Merwin writes without punctuation, as if even the pauses between thoughts are part of the same unbroken fabric. There are no full stops here — just as there are none in experience, not really. One moment flows into the next, the rain into the field, the year into the year.

What catches us is the plainness of his noticing. Grasses changing color. A window. A valley. He is not describing anything extraordinary, and that is precisely the point. The extraordinary is always already here, folded into the unremarkable texture of an afternoon. We just keep forgetting to look.

"I am not young. And yet I feel young." This is not denial or nostalgia — it is a different kind of attention. The body ages. The calendar turns. But something in us remains startled by existence, still watching the leaves blow as if for the first time. Merwin gives us permission to hold both truths at once: the weight of time passing and the lightness of being present within it.

Life unrolls like an endless bolt of cloth. We are somewhere in the middle of it, unable to see the whole pattern. And maybe that is enough — to feel the texture of this one stretch, right here, under our hands.
